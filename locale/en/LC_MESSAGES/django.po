Otherwise, it can generate significant increase of heat in your home through glasses directly exposed to it.<br>Windows can suffer this problem during noon time (if oriented to South), in the morning (if oriented to South East), during the early afternoon (if oriented to South West) or during the afternoon (if oriented to the West). To reduce this problem, you may place shading elements out of the windows of these rooms such as sunshades or venetian or roll-up shutters (ligth colours) that avoid most of the heat increases of your home.<br>Use of curtains or interior shutters is a less efficient option since they do not avoid your windows to heat them up, as exterior shading does. However, it is a useful option if lacking of shading elements outside or as an additional help to them."
